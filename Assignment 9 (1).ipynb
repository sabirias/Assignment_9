    "1. Encapsulation:\n",
    "   Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit.\n",
    "   This can be done by using access modifiers, such as public, private, and protected. Public methods can be\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Abstract classes:\n",
    "   Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated directly. They can only be used as base classes for\n",
